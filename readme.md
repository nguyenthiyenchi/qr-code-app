## Installation

1. First, clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nguyenthiyenchi/qr-code-app
   ```

2. Second, make sure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed.
   
   The **tkinter** and **io** library are parts of the Python standard library and doesn't need to be installed separately.

   - **tkinter**: tkinter is Python's standard library for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs). It provides a set of tools and widgets to build windows, dialogs, buttons, and other interactive elements for desktop applications.
   - **io**: The io module in Python provides core tools for working with binary and text I/O (input and output). It allows you to read from and write to various types of streams, such as files, memory buffers, and network connections.

   You can install **qrcode** and **PIL** using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install qrcode[pil]
   ```

   - **qrcode**: The qrcode library enables the generation of QR codes from textual data. It is commonly used to encode information like URLs, contact details, or other data into QR codes for use in various applications.
   - **Pillow (PIL Fork)**: Pillow, a fork of the Python Imaging Library (PIL), is a powerful library for image processing and manipulation. It allows you to open, modify, and save various image file formats, perform operations like resizing, cropping, and filtering, and create visual elements for use in graphical applications.
